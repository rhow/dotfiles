<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(11:29:38 PM)</font> <b>mikaeldice:</b></font> I was thinking that I could create a generator for sails.js that provides common services consumable by Angular.js and the basic templates utilizing them.  Maybe made them modular in form, so someone could pull in, say, a messaging module separately from a chat module, so that they don&apos;t need both, but with both requiring another that exposes a generic &apos;users&apos; interface<br/>
