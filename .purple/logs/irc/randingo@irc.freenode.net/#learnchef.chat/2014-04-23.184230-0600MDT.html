<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(06:58:39 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> hi, (i'm not sure which channel to ask/discuss this topic, here or #chef).  My question is in regards to development of recipes with multiple developers.  Me and a couple of my coworkers are working on a product that includes chef, a particular cookbook, and a bunch of recipes.  We each work on a separate recipe within the same cookbook, and separate VM instances.  When I 'knife upload  &lt;cookbook&gt;'; and the coworker executes 'chef-client', their recipe is clobbered.<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(06:59:57 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> I'm wondering what our options are.  Currently we use Git to push changes and communicate a change and a pull is recommended, before uploading the cookbook again.<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(07:00:37 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> For me, new to chef, I would prefer to upload the cookbook at whim.<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(07:00:47 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> To test my changes.<br/>
