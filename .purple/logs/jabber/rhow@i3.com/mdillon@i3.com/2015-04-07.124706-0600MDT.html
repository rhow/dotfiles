<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(12:47:45 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>so, just a public key is necessary for the devservices git user ?</span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(01:10:15 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>i put that public key on my user and it appears to have worked, although i didn't specify my user in the git task.<br/>I guess it doesn't matter, it's based on &quot;does private key unlock a public key associated with a user that has access to the repo&quot;. (?)  <br/>I guess long term would be to remove the one on my account, and use the one on the devservices user.</span><br/>
