<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:20:47 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>mike, regarding dev-41l for DW's demo.  I'm not seeing arobin's account on the machine.  it looks like Mark has been doing OpenLayer's dev on it?  You know anything about the state of dev-41l?</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(09:24:02 AM)</font> <b>Michael Dillon:</b></font> I do not...<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(09:24:24 AM)</font> <b>Michael Dillon:</b></font> I think David Eye needed to 'move it', but I don't know that entailed<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:25:21 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>mark replied that dev-41l is his development box.</span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:25:32 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>would that be a VM?</span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:26:07 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>i have a feeling we have two dev-41l's</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(09:31:04 AM)</font> <b>Michael Dillon:</b></font> sounds like somebody repurposed the name   :-/<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(09:31:08 AM)</font> <b>Michael Dillon:</b></font> grrrr<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:32:18 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>yep, that's what i'm thinking.</span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:43:46 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>i've been reconsidering the Play Framework because of Scala and SBT, from reading they're both a pain in the ass.</span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:49:24 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>i think Scala can be minimized in the templating engine, and if it's REST and an Angular client it's likely it's a small portion of the effort.  SBT on the other hand, is another beast.  Maven seems to be the goto for CI in the community; but support for it in Play seems to be fading.  In the end, I'm not warm and fuzzy with Typesafe.</span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(05:04:39 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>This has some good general insight:<br/><a href="http://www.diogonunes.com/blog/rails-vs-django-vs-play-frameworks/">http://www.diogonunes.com/blog/rails-vs-django-vs-play-frameworks/</a></span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:22:04 PM)</font> <b>Michael Dillon:</b></font> East coast friend: &quot;We looked pretty hard at Play, but mostly Akka (Typesafe's magical scaling framework) and separately at Scala at my previous gig. We considered Java (not Scala) Play for the same reason anybody looks at, say, Rails and says &quot;Hm, this seems like someone should really make one good way to do this stuff and avoid reinventing the wheel for every web application.&quot;<br/><br/>Scala is popular with all the Java folks who want the JVM libraries but wish they were writing Python or Go, but I don't see it as much of a revolution.<br/><br/>I've met a few of the execs at Typesafe - they seem to have equal interest in developing a good tech stack as they do selling consulting and training on that stack, and their Akka implementations often missed a lot of basic things you'd think would be important in a framework most people end up using for some kind of messaging/self-scaling async work system. Over time they've filled in the gaps, but they went years without any best-practice way to spin up a &quot;guaranteed&quot; message queue. Lots of ways for other semi-resilient types of work, but that was a gap I found kind of telling in their stack.<br/><br/>So, you'll see Scala picked up a lot and definitely be able to find work in it if that's your desire, it features some interesting language-level async primitives (Futures or Promises, I forget which ones they use), but I'm not convinced it's especially revolutionary, and I'm not entirely sure I trust the foundation that's pushing it since they have a vested interest in it being just short of flexible enough for anybody to really scale up into.&quot;<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(01:22:38 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>nice!  (that's almost as much stuff John flings at me)</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:22:48 PM)</font> <b>Michael Dillon:</b></font> West coast (David Mitchell) &quot;I hear about Scala a little bit, not much, but some. I know Klout uses it and I have some friends over there. They seem to enjoy it. One of those friends was recently looking for a new job as a Scala API engineer, and it didn't take him long to find one. <br/><br/>Ruby still seems to be darling of the valley, but I think it also depends on the scenario. For web dev and rapid prototyping, rails/node are quick and developers are dime a dozen. But, for scale or mega processing, ruby ain't so great, so that might be why a lot of companies migrate to Scala. I know at Klout, they had a pipeline into twitter's feed and would read and analyze millions of tweets per second, and transform all kinds of computations back out in a matter of hours. <br/><br/>I've looked into for a few projects, but it never has quite fit. Every time, C#, ruby or <span style='font-weight: bold;'>gasp</span> even node has been simpler and had an easier learning curve. If you're not pushing lots of data or doing some crazy math, seems like there are simpler solutions. Although, one time a previous developer left a few scripts in scala that I got tired of maintaining, so I ported them to C#. <br/><br/>As for companies, aside from Klout, I know Twitter famously switched to it from Ruby. Linkedin and foursquare are two other pretty big companies. &quot;<br/>
