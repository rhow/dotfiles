<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(10:39:20 AM)</font> <b>Jeff Porter:</b></font> I have a question from a client regarding Linux and our development environment.  Is this possibly something you could chime in on?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(10:39:33 AM)</font> <b>Jeff Porter:</b></font> &quot;The other question that came up yesterday has to do with the software is associated with your content development.  Basically is all of this done under Linux and, if so, are you running under Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  This has to do with Navy Information Assurance issues/requirements.&quot;<br/>
