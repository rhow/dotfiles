<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:45:29 PM)</font> <b>Daiva Gardner:</b></font> Randy, I didn't ask you for an updated estimate on ticket #9935... the initial estimate (from John, I think?) was 12 hours and I'm sure you've spent more time on it than that already (of course, understanding that there is a learning curve and all).  Do you have a guess as to how long you think it will end up taking overall?<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:53:06 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>i'll update it</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:59:08 PM)</font> <b>Daiva Gardner:</b></font> ok!  And, do you still need/use an MSDN subscription?  I think you will still need MSDN tools for MUGG work... yes?<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:00:09 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>yeah, that and the TCOD Manager app, and likely Nokia/HERE application.  So, yes.</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:00:52 PM)</font> <b>Daiva Gardner:</b></font> ok.  Michelle is looking to understand the total number that we need to renew, so ... just chekin'.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:05:14 PM)</font> <b>Daiva Gardner:</b></font> sorry, one more Q... I think we had purchased an IntelliJ package for you, but Mike thought you possibly didn't need the whole package but just WebStorm?  We are trying to figure out how many more we need to purchase...<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:06:00 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>you can repurpose mine to someone else.</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:06:25 PM)</font> <b>Daiva Gardner:</b></font> ok, thanks ... do you still need WebStorm, or no?<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:07:45 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>not at the moment.  Mike and I just got licenses purchased for Sublime.  So, I'll use that for the time being.  Thanks.</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:08:06 PM)</font> <b>Daiva Gardner:</b></font> ok, thanks for clarifying!<br/>
