<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:44:50 PM)</font> <b>Bobby Ross:</b></font> Cloned Spotlive01 to Spotlive02. admin1 is the username password is Passw0rd (capital p). Can you pass that information over to D Wright for me? I kepts the IP address dynamic. I am not sure what you need on there, but admin1 has sudo rights, so go ahead and configure them how you would like. Also, in vsphere they are names MosaicSpotlive and Spotlive02. I tried changing the name but couldnt remotely.  <br/>
