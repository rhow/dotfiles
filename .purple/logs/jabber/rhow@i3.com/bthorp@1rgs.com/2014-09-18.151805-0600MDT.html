<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:18:05 PM)</font> <b>Bill Thorp:</b></font> I've got two things for you....<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:18:56 PM)</font> <b>Bill Thorp:</b></font> #1)  I'm going to crowdsource nothing in particular on kickstarter.com - probably like a Jello mold or something - but I'm going to call it &quot;Kickstart my Heart&quot; and get riiiich<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:20:56 PM)</font> <b>Bill Thorp:</b></font> #2)  I invented a new cocktail without actually trying it.  Its a Framboise (the liquer, not the beer) + whiskey + ginger (ale) .... I call it a &quot;Frisky Ginger&quot;<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:30:14 PM)</font> <b>Bill Thorp:</b></font> okay, three things....<br/>#3) The first thing to know about wasabi - or Wasabia japonica, as it's officially known - is that you have probably never tried the real thing.  That light green paste nestled next to the pink ginger in your box of sushi? It is most likely a mix of mustard, European horseradish, and food colouring.<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:42:17 PM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>All very interesting Bill!  Thanks for that.  Yeah, I'd heard that the sushi &quot;wasabi&quot; wasn't the real stuff.  And it was &quot;related&quot; to mustard... because it is!</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:42:36 PM)</font> <b>Bill Thorp:</b></font> thanks, I try   :D<br/>
