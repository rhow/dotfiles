<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:44:58 PM)</font> <b>Jana Peek:</b></font> Hi Randy, so we are at the end of the month here in accounting and I wanted to check on the progress of the MUGG Foundational Work for SPO2-14-013?  You mentioned that much of one of the line items was already completed in September, can you tell me if this has been completed in October?<br/>

I'd have to consult with David Wright.  And he's not back in the office until Thursday.  So, it's unlikely that'll it'll be delivered in Oct. </span><br/>
