<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:41:28 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>hey, when's the plumber coming to look into the men's room, it's getting rather ripe in there ?</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(09:43:02 AM)</font> <b>Greta Fielitz:</b></font> the plumber came last week but they had to schedule another company to come in to completely clean the drains and they can't come until Wednesday... <br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:45:09 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>oh... ok.  Good to know.  (Just to throw in my opinion, I think water-less urinals are becoming overrated.)  Thanks.</span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(09:46:20 AM)</font> <b>Greta Fielitz:</b></font> lol i completely agree with you! they are more of a hassle then they are worth, but the cost to change them to normal ones is a bit high...(definitely looked into this option :)) <br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(09:49:18 AM)</font> <b>Randy How:</b></font> <span style='color: #0a841a;'>yeah, i figure so.  I'm sure there are no supply lines.  We could each finish up with a cup of fresh water as a chaser.   =]<br/>Thanks for the info.  Have a great day!</span><br/>
