What's the purpose of the Menu bar options? 
- I don't see them being accessible 
- Added '(menu-bar-mode -1)' to .emacs and C-x C-e (eval.) and menu be-gone
  - meta-control-x, also executes eval

Motion to begining of buffer stops 
- go to the end of document (end of buffer)
- paging up (fn up arrow)     

It appears that TMUX hijacks some key strokes

shift pretty much anything makes a selection/starts a buffer
- although shift-cntl arrow left/right does not select/start buffer
- alt-f jumps a word - how to select/create buffer by word


M-> or M-< (Alt-left or right arrows) don't function to go to beginning or end of buffer.?? 
I thought C-SPC did something.
